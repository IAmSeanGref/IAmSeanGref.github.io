# Plan for SeanGref.com

> Failing to plain is planning to fail
> 
> `- `someone

This website will be my resume, my musings, my public showcase. It will be the embodiment of my marketable self. Anything creative I want to publish to the world will be contained here, from music, websites, art, short stories, to political and philosophical writings.

## Features
- Main page
- Project pages
- Blog
- Calendar
- Arbitrary auxilary pages
- Consistent, _but optional_, theme

The majority of content could be considered "project pages" (including music, websites, stories). 

## Technologies
- Markdown for project pages and blog
- Maybe Markdown for calendar?
- Doesn't require a server reload for page additions/changes
- _NOT_ WordPress...
